My name is ToJuana Newsome and I'm aspiring Software Engineer.
I live in San Francisco, CA but I'm from Monterey, CA. 
I have lived in San Francisco for 10yrs and I really enjoy it.
My hobby is reading. I enjoy reading because it allows me
to travel anywhere in the world. I can enjoy any food I want
I can also learn whatever I want to learn. I believe knowledge
is everything and once you have it, no one can ever take that away
from you.

In order to get the most out of reading you must have a broad
range of reading material. First, explore all of the free options
such as public library. Reading can get expensive. Second, you should have a collection of 
books in all forms, audio, softback, hardback, and online. It’s good to have reading material for whatever situation you may be in.
Third, you should join a book club. It’s good  have a community
of people that you can experience certain books with.
