Welcome to my portifolio!

My name is ToJuana Newsome and I am an Aspiring Software
Engineer. I am switching from my long-time profession as an
Excutive Assistant and very excited about entering the Tech industy.

I enjoy the challenge that coding provides for me. 

When I'm not self teaching myself to code I enjoy reading.
Please check out my Art of Reading page for more information
on my hobby of reading.
