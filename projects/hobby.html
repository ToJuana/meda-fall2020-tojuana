<h1>The Art Of Reading</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Art of Reading with ToJuana</h2>
<p>My name is ToJuana and I'm aspiring Software Engineer.
    I live in San Francisco, CA but I'm from Monterey, CA. I enjoy living in San Francisco because of the many many culture that
    the city contains. My hobby is reading. I enjoy reading because it allows me
    to travel anywhere in the world. I visit places that I may never get to physically visit in this lifetime.
    I can enjoy any food that I want. I like to read about food and then try to find that food in San Francisco
    I can also learn whatever I want to learn. I can decide that I want to learn about something or someone and I 
    can usually find a book on the subject. I believe knowledge
    is everything and once you have it, no one can ever take that away
    from you.</p>


<h3>Enjoying the Art of Reading</h3>
<p>In order to get the most out of reading you must have a broad
    range of reading material. First, explore all of the free options
    such as public library. Reading can get real expensive before you know it. I like the check the library first when a 
    new book comes out. Second, you should have a collection of 
    books in all forms, audio, softback, hardback, and online. 
    It’s good to have reading material for whatever situation you may be in. Whether your outside or inside, on the beach(paperback), in the car(audio), on a plane(notepad), taking a walk(audio) or even on the treadmill(hardback).
    Third, you should join a book club. It’s good  have a community of people that you can experience certain books with. You can refer
    a good book that you read or you take suggestions from others. Overall sometimes it's better with a like minded community.
